# Running the code
> Note: [Pdf](Assignment2.pdf) file is well formatted and easy to read. Section `1.9` contains all the inferences and comparisons of the models. It is recommended to read this section first.

## Requirements
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies in your environment.

## Running the code
- Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to open the notebook in your browser.
- Open the `Assignment2.ipynb` file and run the cells in the notebook.

## Simply want to see the results?
- Open the `Assignment2.pdf` file to see the results of the notebook.

# Assignment #2

## Objective: 
> This assignment focuses on understanding and comparing the performance of different machine learning models for predicting cancer types based on a given dataset. You will analyse Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random forest (RF), neural network (NN) regression and other relevant techniques.

## Instructions:

### Code Overview:
Write a python script for the topics mentioned above
Identify the main sections for data import, manipulation, model training, and result storage.

### Data Description:
Briefly introduce the dataset, its columns, and the target variable (cancer types).

### Discuss the SVM analysis:
Explain SVM's role in cancer type prediction.
Use different kernels 

### Elaborate on the neural network regression analysis:
Describe the significance of neural networks in cancer type prediction.
Explain the grid search process for neural network parameters.
Compare neural network results with other models.

### Comparison:
Contrast the performance of the three models:
Discuss strengths and weaknesses of SVM, and neural networks for predicting cancer types.
Identify the most suitable model for the task based on accuracy and efficiency.

### Discussion:
Reflect on the broader implications of accurate cancer type prediction.
Consider real-world applications of the models' performance.

### Conclusion:
#### Summarise findings:
- Highlight the best-performing model and rationale.
- Stress the importance of thoughtful model selection and parameter tuning in machine learning.

## Submission:
Create a concise document with the outlined sections.
Include necessary code snippets or visuals to support explanations.
Provide references for external resources used.
